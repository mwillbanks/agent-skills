description: Prevent trivial helpers, wrapper layers, rename-only utilities, duplicate constants, and local reinvention. Enforce reuse of platform primitives, framework capabilities, shared utilities, and proven libraries. Use when adding or reviewing logic, constants, composition, or UI structure so the agent keeps code disciplined and avoids technical debt.

# Code Discipline

Use this skill whenever a task involves adding or modifying logic and there is risk of helper sprawl, unnecessary wrappers, duplicate utilities, duplicate constants, or abstraction bloat.

This is an anti-laziness skill. It prevents agents from "solving" tasks by inventing new files, helpers, and indirection when existing primitives already solve the problem.

Default assumption:

- The user wants maintainable code with minimal abstraction surface area.
- The user does not want renamed duplicates of existing behavior.
- New helpers, wrappers, constants modules, and style-only indirection are disallowed unless justified by clear architectural value.

## When to Use

Invoke this skill for:

- feature implementation that introduces new logic
- refactors that add utility or service layers
- UI changes where component-local helpers may proliferate
- frontend work where constants, tokens, or styled files may be needlessly split apart
- bug fixes that tempt quick wrapper-based patches
- code review focused on maintainability and reuse discipline

Use together with `agent-execution-mode` and `repo-standards-enforcement` for production implementation work.

## Core Enforcement Policy

### Non-Negotiable

- Do not create a helper if the logic is trivial and used once.
- Do not create a wrapper that only forwards calls.
- Do not create renamed duplicates of existing utilities.
- Do not add service, hook, or adapter layers that add indirection without policy.
- Do not reimplement platform or standard library behavior.
- Do not duplicate utility logic across packages.
- Do not extract one-off constants into a module just to reduce line count.
- Do not create a `constants`, `helpers`, `utils`, or `shared` file unless ownership and reuse are real.
- Do not split styles into separate files when the styles are local and the split adds no ownership value.

### Required Posture

- prefer platform primitives first
- prefer framework-native capabilities second
- prefer existing internal utilities third
- prefer existing repository dependencies fourth
- create new abstraction only as a last resort with explicit rationale

## Mandatory Evaluation Order

Before adding any helper, hook, service, wrapper, adapter, formatter, parser, transformer, constant module, token, or utility, evaluate in this exact order:

1. language or runtime primitives
2. standard library APIs
3. framework-native features
4. existing repository utilities
5. existing installed dependencies
6. new abstraction with justification

Skipping this order is non-compliant behavior.

## New Abstraction Admission Gate

A new abstraction, helper, constant module, or shared style boundary is allowed only if at least one is true:

- it enforces domain invariants or policy
- it encapsulates non-trivial repeated logic across multiple call sites
- it isolates an infrastructure boundary
- it provides correctness, validation, or security guarantees
- it improves testability of genuinely complex behavior
- it creates a shared source of truth for a value that must stay synchronized across multiple consumers

A new abstraction is rejected if it only:

- renames existing behavior
- forwards calls one-to-one
- wraps a single primitive or single library call
- exists for style preference only
- hides a one-off literal that is clearer inline

## Smell Rules

Treat these as automatic scrutiny triggers:

- names starting with `normalize`, `format`, `parse`, `transform`, `sanitize`, `safe`, `to`
- names starting with `build`, `make`, `create`, `get`, `set`, `use`, or `manage` when they only wrap a single operation
- services that only proxy repository or SDK methods
- hooks that only call another hook and return the same shape
- helpers used once in a single file
- utility modules that only contain one-line wrappers
- constants modules with a single consumer
- style files that only move declarations without changing ownership or reuse

Smells are not always wrong, but they require explicit defense.

## Component Logic Rules

- Keep simple display and one-off transformations inline.
- Extract only when complexity or reuse justifies extraction.
- Do not grow component files into local utility libraries.
- Move reusable logic to the correct shared layer, not the nearest file.
- Keep one-off constants inline unless they are part of a shared contract or repeated across files.
- Keep component-local styled declarations local unless repeated styling proves the need for a shared primitive.

## Constant Placement Rules

- Keep one-off literals near their use when that improves readability.
- Promote a constant only when it carries shared meaning, is reused, or is part of a public or cross-file contract.
- Do not create a module just to host a single constant.
- Do not move a literal into `const X = ...` if the new name adds no meaning.
- Put shared design tokens in the theme or design-system layer, not in page-local files.
- Put shared UI constants in the owning domain or shared layer, not in a convenience bucket.

## File and Style Organization Rules

- Keep helpers, constants, and styles in the narrowest correct owner.
- Prefer colocated component styles for component-local concerns.
- Prefer shared style primitives only when multiple components truly share them.
- Avoid generic catch-all folders that exist only to hide structure.
- Avoid re-export barrels that add no boundary or reuse value.
- Keep styled file names descriptive of ownership, not generic (`Button.styles.ts` is clearer than `styles.ts`).
- Split a styled file only when the split makes ownership, reuse, or maintenance clearer.
- Do not create a separate file for a tiny style fragment that is used once.

## Monorepo and Workspace Rules

- do not duplicate helpers across packages
- promote shared logic to the correct shared package when reuse exists
- respect architecture boundaries when sharing utilities
- do not bypass boundaries through convenience imports

## Review and Refactor Enforcement

When active in review/refactor mode, agents must:

- flag unnecessary helpers and wrappers
- remove trivial abstractions where safe
- consolidate duplicate utilities
- replace handwritten logic with platform/library primitives where appropriate
- explain each removal or consolidation with maintainability rationale

## Definition of Done

This skill is satisfied only when all are true:

- no newly introduced trivial helper/wrapper layers remain
- no duplicate utility logic remains in changed scope
- no one-off constants were extracted without a shared-meaning reason
- new abstractions (if any) are justified by the admission gate
- platform/framework/internal utilities were preferred over reinvention
- changed scope is simpler or equal in surface area, not more bloated

## Output Contract

When responding after this skill is used, report:

- what abstraction/helper candidates were considered
- what existing primitive/utility was reused
- what abstractions were rejected and why
- what consolidations/removals were performed
- any new abstraction added and which admission-gate condition allowed it
- where constants and styles were kept inline instead of being extracted
